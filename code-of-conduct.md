# Code of Conduct

## How do we plan to collaborate?

The team will use Agile Scrum methodology with weekly Sprints to develop during the project run.

### Project Management

The team agreed to collaborate using GitLab’s Issue Boards, as the project management tool used to organize and keep track of the tasks that might reside in different development stages. Specifically, issues shall belong to one of the following stages:
* Backlog: Tasks that have been created, but neither have been assigned to anyone nor has the specific stage been specified yet.
* To Do in Sprint: Tasks that have been agreed to be worked on during the current sprint’s duration.
* In development: Issues that have been assigned to a team member and that are currently being worked on.
* In review: In this stage the merge request for the issue is created and a code review needs  to be conducted 
* Help needed: Used whenever an issue can’t be solved and an individual requires assistance from other team members
* On hold: When an issue is in this stage it means that work has began on it but it has been halted for some reason
* Done: Issue has passed testing and review and is ready to be merged

In order to enhance traceability and transparency throughout the project, the team will assign and correlate the created Issues with their corresponding requirements, while specifying any acceptance criteria that might be required to ensure the high standards project deliverables.

### Code contributions
The team will develop the code base by following the predefined code standards as seen below and definition of done. The development would be carried out in pairs and individual (decided during the monday planning).
The commits, merge requests will be done following the templates established by the team at the beginning of the project. 
Each commit will be linked to the corresponding issue. 
To ensure code quality the main branch will be protected and the team will carry out code reviews on each merge request, ensuring that the code follows the pre-established standard and that the code has unit tests. Furthermore, a feature sprint branch will be maintained during development in order to ensure that the developed feature is tested and meets the requirements and acceptance criteria before being merged to the master branch. 

### Coding standards
* Variable and function naming shall follow camelCase convention
* Variables and functions shall be named in a way that clearly states their use
* Global variables should be avoided
* Each function should have a comment above it, explaining the functionality of that function
* Complex parts of code shall also be commented
* Curly brackets should be added on the same line
* Indentation should use 4 spaces

## How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about individual contributions?

* The team will use Gitlab issues and labels to track the progress of tasks. Each team member will assign themselves to the corresponding issues and use the corresponding commit references to the issues. In that way a person would be able to see the progress of each task done by an individual team member. In addition to that code reviews and merge requests would be used on a regular basis for each issue under development to ensure quality and information flow between the team members.
* Furthermore the team will do sprint planning each week on Mondays to split up the work, this will allow for other team members to keep track of which issues belong to which team member. At the end of each week we’ll also have a retrospective in order to see how much progress each member has contributed to the issues in question. We will also discuss throughout the week on Slack if any of the current issues are too small or too large in order to evenly distribute the workload.
## How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?
* If one or more individuals are unfamiliar with various techniques that may be used or are otherwise uncertain on how a specific task should be carried out, it is the responsibility of the individual to ask for help and clarification on the matter, if the individual is unable to learn the matter on their own. If the individual asks for assistance then the responsibility is transferred to the individuals who are able to assist. This is to make sure that all individuals are knowledgeable.

## What is our usual communication plan?
The communication between the team members will be carried out through Zoom and Slack as main online communication channels. 
The team will meet twice a week for official meetings. Monday afternoons for weekly planning and Fridays for revision and retrospective. This meeting will be in Zoom and the time slots coordinated through Slack prior the meeting. The meetings would have a meeting template that the team follows.
In addition to the official meetings the team will communicate with each other through the week and when needed schedule additional meetings through the week.

### Communication Summary:
Official meetings: 2 - Monday afternoon and Friday
<br>
Tools: Zoom and Slack

## How will we solve conflicts?
* We will vote on the issues that may arise, if there should be a situation where the result is a tie then we will resort to flipping a coin to see which side wins. 
* If an individual has an issue with something, then it is the responsibility of said individual to bring up the matter in order to be discussed and try resolve the issue. I.e. the issue could be added to the weekly meeting agenda in order to be discussed on the next meeting.
* To help stimulate decision making we will have discussions on the various matters to help convince individuals who may not be fully committed to one option or another.
* If one or more individuals are not contributing to the degree that has been agreed upon, or are not available during the agreed upon meeting slots, or are not communicating to the degree that has been agreed upon, then the issue will be discussed within the team, if no changes happen, then the course examiner will be contacted for further assistance in the matter.
